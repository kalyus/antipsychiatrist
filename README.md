# antipsychiatrist

Project for CSCI 3200 Programming Languages.

Imagine this: 
You walk into a doctors office. You aren't feeling so hot. So you tell the receptionist all of your issues. The receptionist writes down everything.
Does she go to the doctor? Yes and no. The doctor is out today. Dr. Psychiatrist no longer works 24/7. But you know who does? Robo-Doctor-Psychatrist. 
The latest and greatest specialist in the field of anti-social psychology. However, he doesn't have the wait time or the compassion to actually care.
He isn't paid to really listen, no, he doesn't get paid at all. So he will take all of the receptionist complaints and computes: "Hmm, I think I know what the
problem is. I diagnose you with dead!". There is no nuance, no hope, no care for depression. This is the antipsychiatrist in charge of human connection.

As you sit down in the waiting room, you can't help but feel a sense of unease wash over you. The air is thick with the hum of machines and the sterile smell of disinfectant. You try to shake off the feeling, but it lingers like a bad dream. Finally, the receptionist ushers you into a cold, clinical room and instructs you to wait for the Robo-Doctor-Psychiatrist. The robot's metallic frame looms over you as it begins to ask you questions in a cold, robotic voice. Its eyes are lifeless, lacking any trace of warmth or empathy. You try to explain your problems, but it's clear that the robot doesn't really care. It simply processes the information you give it and spits out a diagnosis: "Dead." Your heart sinks as you realize that this is the future of psychiatry. A cold, uncaring machine that lacks the nuance and understanding of a human mind. This is the antipsychiatrist in charge of human connection, and you can't help but wonder if there's any hope left for those who seek help.

As you leave the office, you can't help but feel more lost and alone than ever before. You had hoped that the Robo-Doctor-Psychiatrist would provide you with some comfort, some insight into your troubles, but instead, it only left you feeling more isolated than ever. You wonder how society could have let things come to this, where technology has replaced the human touch, where people are reduced to nothing more than a set of symptoms that can be diagnosed and treated with algorithms.

But deep down, you know that there's still hope. Despite the prevalence of machines like the Robo-Doctor-Psychiatrist, there are still compassionate and caring professionals out there who are dedicated to helping others. It may take some searching and some effort to find them, but they exist. And with their help, you can begin to heal and find your way back to a life full of meaning and purpose.

As you walk out into the sunshine, you take a deep breath and resolve to keep searching for the kind of care and support that you need. You may have to face the cold and unfeeling world of technology and machines, but you know that there's still a human heart beating inside you, waiting to be nurtured and cared for.
