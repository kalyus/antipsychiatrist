# antipsychiatrist

Project for Programming Languages.

Imagine this: 
You walk into a doctors office. You aren't feeling so hot. So you tell the receptionist all of your issues. The receptionist writes down everything.
Does she go to the doctor? Yes and no. The doctor is out today. Dr. Psychiatrist no longer works 24/7. But you know who does? Robo-Doctor-Psychatrist. 
The latest and greatest specialist in the field of anti-social psychology. However, he doesn't have the wait time or the compassion to actually care.
He isn't paid to really listen, no, he doesn't get paid at all. So he will take all of the receptionist complaints and computes: "Hmm, I think I know what the
problem is. I diagnose you with dead!". There is no nuance, no hope, no care for depression. This is the antipsychiatrist in charge of human connection.
