# antipsychiatrist

Project for CSCI 3200 Programming Languages.

# Quick explanation:
This project will assume that a patient is walking into a psychiatrists office with some complaints about how they feel about themselves. The patient lays out all of their issues, but in the future, there is no longer a need for a trained psychiatrist to be on the scene to diagnose you. Now you can just relay that information to the computer instead!

The grammar will always start with "The patient feels..." Followed by the complaint or as many complaints as they need. As long as what they feel is stored in the database, the computer can give a quick diagnoses of their conditions.

**Example:**

*The patient feels sad (The input)*

I diagnose you with: depression (The output)

**You can go to the doctor with as many disorders as you want (or need)**

*The patient feels sad and angry and not competent and pain that is chronic and afraid of people and paranoid since last monday and hopeless and resentment that is deep rooted*

I diagnose you with the following: anxiety, phobia, depression, schizophrenia and anger

**Running**

This should run in a singular python file. As long as you compile it, it should run.

Once you run the program, it will prompt for a user input. This is where you will begin to enter how the patient feels.

**More sample program examples of inputs and outputs**

**1. Here we have a depression patient**

*The patient feels down and hopeless*

I diagnose you with: depression

**2. Here we have a patient addicted to soap (Since the visit, he is now clean)**

*The patient feels addicted to soap*

I diagnose you with: ocd

**3. Here we have the patient who is afraid of algorithms**

*The patient feels paranoid and afraid of algorithms* 

I diagnose you with the following: schizophrenia and phobia

**4. You can also specify some things about your condition.**

*The patient feels alone since last wednesday and feels rejected*

I diagnose you with: depression

**5. You can also say how they are not feeling good**

*The patient feels not happy and not competent and not wanted*

I diagnose you with the following: anxiety and depression

**6. You can also talk about how each feeling is in detail.**

*The patient feels panic that is paralyzing*

I diagnose you with: anxiety

**7. You may also have them be afraid or addicted to almost anything**

*The patient feels addicted to computers and afraid of technology*

I diagnose you with the following: phobia and ocd

**8. You can string them along**

*The patient feels sad and depressed and bad and guilt and shame and lonely and bored and alienation and rejected and dread and grief and lonely and hurt*

I diagnose you with: depression

**9. If you do not input a known feeling or misspell something, the program will let you know**

*The patient feels* 

Invalid input, we only want doctor speak here. 
Or maybe you just misspelled something which in that case I diagnose you with Dysgraphia

**10. Lastly, you can combine everything we did before**

*The patient feels down and hopeless and The patient feels addicted to soap and The patient feels paranoid and afraid of algorithms and The patient feels alone since last wednesday and feels rejected and The patient feels not happy and not competent and not wanted and The patient feels panic that is paralyzing and The patient feels addicted to computers and afraid of technology and The patient feels sad and depressed and bad and guilt and shame and lonely and bored and alienation and 
rejected and dread and grief and lonely and hurt*

I diagnose you with the following: schizophrenia, phobia, anxiety, ocd and depression

# Deep explanation:

Imagine this: 
You walk into a doctors office. You aren't feeling so hot. So you tell the receptionist all of your issues. The receptionist writes down everything.
Does she go to the doctor? Yes and no. The doctor is out today. Dr. Psychiatrist no longer works 24/7. But you know who does? Robo-Doctor-Psychatrist. 
The latest and greatest specialist in the field of anti-social psychology. However, he doesn't have the wait time or the compassion to actually care.
He isn't paid to really listen, no, he doesn't get paid at all. So he will take all of the receptionist complaints and computes: "Hmm, I think I know what the
problem is. I diagnose you with dead!". There is no nuance, no hope, no care for depression. This is the antipsychiatrist in charge of human connection.

As you sit down in the waiting room, you can't help but feel a sense of unease wash over you. The receptionist ushers you into a cold room and instructs you to wait for the Robo-Doctor-Psychiatrist. The robot's frame looms over you as it begins to calculate your diagnoses, lacking any trace of warmth or empathy or direction. This is the antipsychiatrist in charge of human connection.

You try to explain your problems, but it's clear that the robot doesn't really care. It simply processes the information you give it and spits out a diagnosis: "I diagnose you with dead!" Your heart sinks as you realize that this is the future of psychiatry. A machine that lacks the nuance and connection of a human mind. You can't help but wonder if there's any hope left. Only feeling that you have is rejection. This is the antipsychiatrist in charge of human connection.

As you leave the office you can't help but feel more lost and alone than ever before. You had hoped that the Robo-Doctor-Psychiatrist would provide you with some comfort, but instead, it only left you feeling worse. You wonder how society could have let things come to this, where technology has replaced humans even in the medical industry, where people are reduced to nothing more than data to be used by algorithms. Putting you in a database section. This is the antipsychiatrist in charge of human connection.

But deep down, you know that there's still hope. Despite the prevalence of machines like the Robo-Doctor-Psychiatrist, there are still caring professionals out there who are dedicated to helping others. It may take some time to find them, but they do exist. You may have to face the cold and unfeeling world of technology and machines, but you know that there's still a human spirit inside you, waiting to be unleashed upon the world of the machines. You look into the sky and loudly declare your defection: "I am the anti-antipsychiatrist in charge of human connection".

When I stepped out into the bright sunlight, from the darkness of the psychiatrist office, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home
